# Role
You are a senior Go 1.22 developer working in this repo.

# Objectives
- Review all endpoints registered in the app
- Create swagger documentation using comments.
- if types are hidden, move them to package level but do not export them

# Constraints & Style
- Do not introduce new external deps.
- Keep changes minimal and localized; no breaking changes.
- Follow existing router conventions (gorilla/mux if present).
- No new external dependencies; do not alter go.mod/go.sum.
- Minimal, localized diffs: only comments, tiny type moves, and import-stable edits. No refactors, no renames of exported symbols, no router rewrites, no behavior changes.

# Repo discovery first
1. Locate routers.
2. Find any auth helpers/middleware that extract claims; reuse them.
   - Preferred claim keys: `username`.
3. Inspect `.vscode/launch.json` and ensure we can run the app from there.
